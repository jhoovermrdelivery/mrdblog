<span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a party at your place but no one wants to leave to get food? What about those tricky office lunches where the whole crew wants to chip in, but no one has cash? Now, there’s an easier way to fix this problem. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With group ordering from Mr. Delivery, we make it easy for you to take care of your group. All you have to do is:</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Head over to the group order section of the Mr. Delivery site and add your friends to a group with their name and email.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Choose a time and restaurant, and how you’ll be paying for the order. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, everyone that you added to the group will receive an email with the option to customize their orders. How cool is that!</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us take the planning out of the party. You’ll never worry again about the possibility of picking up the tab or that complicated coworkers custom request ever again. We understand the challenges that come with leaving the group to pick up food. Make it easy on yourself and let us do the work while you enjoy the party. From now on, when you want to have big meals delivered, in or out of the office, Mr. Delivery has you covered. </span>
